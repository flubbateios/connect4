	<h2>flubb Connect 4</h2>
	This is a multiplayer Connect 4 implementation but it's fairly customizable. Board sizes up to 100 x 100 are currently allowed, and the amount that you need to connect is customizable.
	This server has support for free for alls and you can choose whether to end the game after one person has won or not. Furthermore, there is a spectator client and winners of free for all games get redirected
	there so they can watch.<br /> Contact me on Steam if you want to make a custom web client for this server and you want to use CORS. It's written in nodeJS and the client uses knockoutJS for pretty much everything.
	All of the files are static and communication to the server is done through socket.io . The only HTTP API is the one to create a game. This specific server is hosted behind a reverse proxy handled by nginx.
	The server I'm using is a Scaleway dedicated server with an Intel Atom c2550 (4x2.4ghz) and 8gb of DDR3 RAM.
